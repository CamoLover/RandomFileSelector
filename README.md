# ðŸŽ² RandomFileSelector

Choose a random file in the directory where the `.py` script is located!

## How It Works

Just place the Python script in the directory where you want to select a random file.

The script is currently set to choose either a video or image file in the current folder. You can specify the file types by editing the `format` list in the following format:

- `*.mp4` for video files
- `*.jpg`, `*.png`, `*.jpeg` for image files
- Add or replace file extensions as needed

## Usage

1. Place the script in your desired directory.
2. Customize the `format` list to include the file types you want.
3. Run the script to select a random file from the specified formats.

## Example Usage

```python
python random_file_selector.py
```

ðŸš€ Quick Start
